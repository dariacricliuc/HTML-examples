    <h3>The Book</h3>
    <a href="#top">Go to the top</a>
    <p>Szpilman’s autobiography, “The Pianist,” came out just after the war. The communist forces in Poland suppressed it because it didn’t “accurately” portray the official view. For example, Hosenfeld was kind, as a German, and some of the Jews in the film were not kind. The “good German” spoiled the communist’s portrayal of every single German as a murdering psychopath beneath a tame exterior. Adolf Eichmann was described by his Jewish captors after his arrest in 1960 as being the epitome of the “banality of evil.” The book presents Szpilman’s existence during his time in the ruins of Warsaw as “the banality of survival.” Unlike other movies, it wasn’t about brandishing weapons and single-handedly taking on entire companies of Nazi infantry. Instead, it’s about the mundane chores of finding bread, having clean clothes, and not having to soil oneself when needing to use the bathroom. The book, too, is about one man’s ability to maximize his chances of survival by giving in to his need for help and shelving his monumental pre-war ego so that he can ingratiate himself to the people upon whom he must depend for his survival. Both the book and the film of the same name attempt to paint Szpilman as a survivor whose harrowing tale both honors and gives voice to the millions, many of whom are faceless and nameless, who perished not only in the Holocaust itself but also in the war and its accompanying methods of killing. More than 60 million people died during World War II. Szpilman’s story deserves to be told to show that even in that maelstrom of death and depravity, survivors do exist and triumph through their banality.</p>

    <h3>Film Analysis</h3>
    <a href="#top">Go to the top</a>
    <p>In film critic Roger Ebert’s review of “The Pianist” he praised the film for being neither sentimental nor thrilling. It simply was. The film is a testament to the combination of the kindness of strangers and blind luck that led to Szpilman’s survival of both the war and the Holocaust. He points out, too, that the story mimics Roman Polanski’s own. Polanski himself says that his mother’s death in the gas chambers haunts him terribly to this day and that only his own death will cause the hurt to cease. Polanski, Ebert notes, was merely a child when he escaped and had to rely on begging and the kindness of strangers to survive. Ebert describes Polanski’s handling of the small vicissitudes of the plot as “masterful.” The bit about Hosenfeld and Szpilman was particularly effective. Further, he remarked that Polanski’s honesty and lack of sentimentality were key factors in his awarding the film both a thumbs-up and 3.5 stars out of four.</p>

    <h3>The Plot</h3>
    <a href="#top">Go to the top</a>
    <p>Wladyslaw Szpilman was a fine pianist who survived the Holocaust and even performed concerts after the war and surviving for nearly five years alone in occupied Warsaw. Before the war, Szpilman played Chopin often on Polish radio. In September 1939, on or soon after the eighth, which is when the Nazis reached Warsaw, Szpilman was playing Chopin on the radio as the Nazis attacked. Although the initial Nazi victories seemed ominous for Poland, there was a generally buoyant mood throughout the government and with people who were in the know. That was because both England and France had promised both military and economic aid and intervention in the event of a Nazi attack. With England, those promises came in the form of an official alliance. Unfortunately for the Poles, however, the western powers reneged on their promises and the alliance and left Poland to hang in the breeze at the mercy of the mighty Wehrmacht. They both declared war on Nazi Germany on September 3, 1939, but they concentrated on Western Europe. Poland was doomed. This disgraceful act is now known as the Western Betrayal. Although the British could only muster four divisions for the expeditionary force, they did nothing whatsoever. They didn’t even make a peep when Russia invaded Poland on September 17, 1939. Emboldened by the west’s craven inaction against Nazi and Russian aggression, the two invaders carved Poland up between them as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Against this backdrop, Szpilman was a voice of Polish pride, his music speaking to Polish hearts. When he fled home, he was one of the hopeful citizens that counted on British and French promises. He is even more crushed when Poland surrenders on October 6, 1939. The atrocities committed against the Polish people almost defy belief. Old men in wheelchairs were tossed out of windows. Nazis and Russians slaughtered entire families during rousts just so that they wouldn’t have to take care of them. And, of course, the Holocaust, although in its infancy, began its inexorably evil destruction. Indeed, of the 3 million Jews living in Poland in 1939, only a few thousand survived until April 1945. Szpilman and his family were put into the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940. They had to struggle to survive. Dead bodies were everywhere. Food was so scarce that sick children were left to die so that well children could eat. Szpilman obviously couldn’t play during the occupation, but he developed a hardness borne of desperation. In 1942, just before he and his family were about to be sent to Treblinnka to be killed, he received a personal reprieve. A friend who was a member of the Ghetto Police shielded him, but the price was horrific. His entire family was taken away. None of them survived. Even though he survived that catastrophe, he was still a slave laborer within the ghetto. He toiled from sunup to sundown every day, which was a miserable existence. One day, he hears about a plan to rebel against the Nazis, and this became the first Warsaw Uprising in 1943. It was unsuccessful and was brutally put down. Szpilman’s hiding place was discovered, and he had to flee to a second safe house. There, a piano taunts him mercilessly because he knows he dare not play lest he be discovered. He nearly starves while in this location, developing jaundice and other nutrient deficiencies. The Second Warsaw Uprising goes down in 1944, and the building where Szpilman is hiding is blown apart by tank shells. He has to flee again for his life. He “ducks and weaves” for months, skirting the edges of the destruction of Warsaw. One day, he sneaks into a house to see if he can find something to eat. There is a can of pickles in the house, and he ravenously attacks the can, trying to open it. A German officer, Hauptmann Wilhelm Hosenfeld, catches him. He takes pity on the starving wretch, not only letting him eat the pickles but also, upon finding out he’s Szpilman, inspires him to play Chopin’s Ballade in G-minor on the piano that was abandoned along with the home. Hosenfeld brings Szpilman food and allows him to hide in the attic, most likely saving his life. Hosenfeld is well-known as a class act who helped Jews throughout the war, often at great peril to himself. He attended mass at Polish churches, which was strictly forbidden. He was certainly no Nazi. When the Red Army liberates Warsaw, Hosenfeld gives Szpilman his greatcoat and tells him that he will listen to Polish radio after the war to hear his friend play. Hosenfeld survived the war but died in a Soviet prison camp in 1952 from injuries brought on by torture. The Russians incorrectly blamed him for spying and for war crimes committed by other members of his unit. Szpilman, however, survived and performed Chopin’s Grand Polonaise brilliante both live in person and on the radio. He died in the year 2000 at the age of 88.</p>
